Project: Metro Route Finder (Bonus Component)
Name: Shessaanand Siva
Roll No: 2025623

Data Sources: DMRC Official Website

============================
 BONUS FEATURES IMPLEMENTED 
============================

1. EXPANDED NETWORK (More Lines)
   - Unlike the basic assignment which asked for Blue and Magenta, this program includes 9 lines:
   - Blue, Magenta, Yellow, Red, Green, Violet, Pink, Grey, and Orange.

2. SMART ROUTING (Least Transfers)
   - Standard shortest path algorithms often pick a route that is 2 minutes faster but requires 3 changes.
   - My logic prioritizes COMFORT. It searches for the route with the MINIMUM NUMBER OF INTERCHANGES first.
   - Travel time is used only as a tie-breaker.

3. DYNAMIC FARE CALCULATION
   - The program calculates fare based on the estimated travel distance (using time as a proxy).
   - It implements the official DMRC fare slabs: Rs 11, 21, 32, 43, 54, 64.
   - It asks the user for the "Day of Travel". If it is "Sunday" or "Holiday", it applies the specific DMRC discounted fare logic.

4. INTERCHANGE PENALTY
   - A logic was added to detect line changes dynamically.
   - If a passenger switches lines (e.g., Blue to Yellow), a 12-minute penalty is added to the total travel time to account for walking and waiting.

5. NO USE OF EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
   - No external libraries are used for data handling.
